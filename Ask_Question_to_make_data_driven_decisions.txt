Most commonly problem in data analytics
1. Making prediction 
   Ex : A company that wants to know the best adcertising method to bring in new customers
2. Categorize things
   Ex :  a company's goal to improve customer satisfaction. Analysts might classify 
         customer service calls based on certain keywords or scores. This could help
         identify top-performing customer service representatives or help correlate 
         certain actions taken with higher customer satisfaction scores.
3. Spotting something unusual
   Ex : A company that sells smart watches that help people monitor their health would
        be interested in designing their software to spot something unusual. Analysts 
        who have analyzed aggregated health data can help product developers determine 
        the right algorithms to spot and set off alarms when certain data doesn't trend normally.
4. Identifying themes 
   Ex : categorizing things involves assigning items to categories; identifying themes takes those
        categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.
5. dicovering connections
   Ex : A third-party logistics company working with another company to get shipments delivered to
        customers on time is a problem requiring analysts to discover connections. By analyzing the
        wait times at shipping hubs, analysts can determine the appropriate schedule changes
        to increase the number of on-time deliveries. 
6. Finding patterns
   Ex : Minimizing downtime caused by machine failure is an example of a problem requiring analysts
        to find patterns in data. For example, by analyzing maintenance data, they might discover
        that most failures happen if regular maintenance is delayed by more than a 15-day window.
